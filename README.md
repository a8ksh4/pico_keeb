# t9
A one-handed t9 based keyboard, inspired by the recent work by Guy Dupont: https://hackaday.io/project/179977-standalone-t9-predictive-keyboard.  This is intended to be a fully functional one-handed 16% keyboard, with emphais on supporting linux cmd line operation and programming!

I was looking for a project to work on for experiende with Circuit Pytnon and the Pi Pico.  This one gets bonus points because it's an opportunity to explore machine learning!
